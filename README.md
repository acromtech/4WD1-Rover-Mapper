## Description
### About the A4WD1 v2 Robot
The Lynxmotion Aluminum 4WD1 Robot Kit is a robust, modifiable, and expandable chassis for RC or autonomous robot experimentation. By utilizing popular RC truck tires and wheels the robot has excellent traction. Using our small NiMH battery packs and the Sabertooth 2x10 R/C motor controller means there is plenty of room inside for additional electronics. However, if you run out of room inside we have additional decks that can be added to the top for future expansion. The robot is capable of carrying up to a 5lb payload.

### The Mechanics
The robot chassis is made from heavy-duty anodized aluminum structural brackets and ultra-tough laser-cut Lexan panels. It includes four 12.0vdc 30:1 gear head motors and our 4.75" tires and wheels.

### Controlling the Robot
The robot is currently available in several configurations for RC or autonomous operation. 

### Powering Options
The robot is compatible with a 6.0 - 12vdc Ni-CD & Ni-MH Universal Smart Charger (USC-02)
